# Airdrop List

A sleek, full-stack application for tracking the latest **airdrops**, **faucets**, and **waitlists** across crypto projects.

##  Features

##  Architecture Overview

The repository is divided into:
- `client`: Front-end application (TypeScript, CSS, possibly React or similar).
- `server`: Back-end logic—handles data aggregation, APIs, and project logic.

##  Tech Stack
- **Languages**: TypeScript, CSS, JavaScript, HTML  
- **Front-end**: (e.g., React, Vue, or plain TS + CSS; adjust as applicable)
- **Back-end**: (e.g., Node.js + Express; adapt based on actual stack)
- **Enhancements**: Responsive layout, dark mode, sleek glass/UI design (if included)
